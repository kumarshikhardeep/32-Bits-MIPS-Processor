# 32-Bits-MIPS-Processor
Project - 32 bits MIPS Processor built using Verilog

Prerequisites- 
->To run this project you must have a verilog compiler installed on your local machine(I used "Icarus Verilog").

Getting Started-
->To compile selected modules, use this command:
    iverilog file1.v file2.v file3.v
->To compile all modules at once, use this command:
    iverilog *.v
->After compiling "a.out" file is generated.
->To execute the compiled modules, use this command:
    vvp a.out

Results-
This processor successfully performs following operations:
->Arithmatic Operations such as Addition and Subtraction
->Logical Operations such as Logical AND and Logical OR
->LOAD and STORE operations
->Branch Operations

Acknowledgement and Purpose-
This project is built for partial fulfillment of the course Foundation of Computer Systems- CS541
